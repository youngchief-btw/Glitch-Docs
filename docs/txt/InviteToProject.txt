Invite people to projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options

-   1. Invite them using clicking their profile picture while they are
    viewing your project (DOESN'T WORK ON PRIVATE PROJECTS).
-   2. Send them an invite link, which gives them access (editing, etc).
    To do this, go to the editor, click on the top left where it says
    'Share', and there you go, send that invite link to them. This invite link will only be valid for a while, then it will expire.
